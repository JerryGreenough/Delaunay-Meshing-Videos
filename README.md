# Delaunay Meshing Videos
<strong>Purpose:</strong> Creation of animations that depict iterations from the Delaunay algorithm for the generation of optimal, unrefined triangular meshes.

## Introduction

<p>
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how the Animation module of the Python library <code>matplotlib</code> can be used to generate an mp4 video that illustrates the
Delaunay triangulation algorithm. The objective of Delaunay triangulation is to generate a mesh of geometrically optimal triangles within a prescribed boundary.
The work presented here demonstrates the first step of this process, which is to generate the 'unrefined' mesh, in which the only nodes present within the mesh are those 
that define the boundary itself. If the mesh were to be used as part of an Engineering analysis (such as Finite Element modeling), then a second 'refinement' stage 
would be required, wherein additional nodes are inserted into the interior of the boundary in order to improve mesh quality. 
</p>

<p>
The following images illustrates a simple Delaunay triangulation (right hand image) constructed from a boundary loop (left hand image). The nodes that define the boundary are represented by red circles. The edges that form the boundary loop are blue, with the remaining interior edges being colored black.

</p>

<p>
An example of an animation of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm is shown in the following .mp4 video. The video starts with just the boundary nodes (in red). 
Each subsequent frame of the animation depicts the state of the mesh after the introduction of a boundary edge that is defined between two adjacent nodes of the boundary loop. The boundary edges are added between consecutively defined nodes and in an order that is counter-clockwise. The element edges that emerge during the process are colored black save for the boundary edges, which are colored blue. The meshing algorithm maintains a convex hull of all nodes that are contained in the boundary edges that have been added up to that point. This necessitates the generation of temporary edges and elements that lie outside the blue prescribed boundary edges. For any given iteration of the alogrithm, the edges of the convex hull of all hitherto-added edge nodes are colored gray. The final iteration of the algorthim removes all elements that lie outside the prescribed boundary loop to reveal the boundary loop plus any elements that are contained in its interior.

## Delaunay Meshing



## Frame Grabbing

<p>
The frame-grabbing functionality is implemented using the Python graphics library <code>matplotlib</code>. This library has a submodule named <code>animation</code>, 
which contains the definition of the FFMpegWriter class.
</p>

```   
from matplotlib.animation import FFMpegWriter
```
The overall process for writing frames to an .mp4 file is now summarized. 
The key ingredients of the process are:

* A matplotlib Figure and Axis pair
* An instance of the matplotlib.animation MovieWriter class
* A MovieWriter context manager that hosts the frame-grabbing process
* The MovieWriter object's grab_frame() method - which saves the state of the Figure to a video frame

The process makes use of a context manger 'saving' associated with the MovieWriter 
instance <code>writer</code>.


A frame is added to the mp4 file
The MovieWriter context manager <code>saving</code> is initialized with three parameters:

* The matplotlib Figure to which drawing commands are written.
* The name of the .mp4 file to which the animation data should be written.
* The DPI (or resolution) for the file. This controls the size in pixels of the resulting movie file.

```
file_name = 'something.mp4'
figsize=(6,6)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=figsize)
writer = FFMpegWriter(fps=2)
	
with self.writer.saving(fig, file_name, 200):
	for iteration in algorithm:
		mesh_data = create_mesh_data()
		draw_commands = create_plot_commands(mesh_data)
		
		# Update the Matplotlib figure 'fig'
		
		add_to_figure(fig, draw_commands)
		
		# Grab the current state of the matplotlib Figure 'fig'.
	
		writer.grab_frame()
```

During the initialization phase, a number of objects are created for later reference by the frame-grabbing functions during the Delaunay
triangulation process. This is achieved with a call to the mesh object's ```vplot_init()``` method. The primary 

```
def vplot_init(self, fpath, figsize=(6,6)):

    fhandle = Path(fpath)
    fhandle.touch(exist_ok=True) # Create the mp4 file if it doesn't already exist.
	
    self.fpath = fpath
    
    self.fig, self.axs = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=figsize)
    self.writer = FFMpegWriter(fps=2)
```

```
def addBoundaryLoopWithVideo(self, nodeList):
    with self.writer.saving(self.fig, self.fpath, 200):
        self.addBoundaryLoop(nodeList, video=True)

def addBoundaryLoop(self, nodeList, video=False):

    self.addNodes(nodeList)
    for ixn in range(len(nodeList)-1):
        self.insertBoundaryEdge([ixn, ixn+1])
        if video: self.vplot(self.writer, self.fig, self.axs, labels=False, arrows=False)

    self.insertBoundaryEdge([len(nodeList)-1, 0])
    if video: self.vplot(self.writer, self.fig, self.axs, labels=False, arrows=False)
    
    self.removeNonFeatureBoundaryEdges()
    if video: self.vplot(self.writer, self.fig, self.axs, labels=False, arrows=False)
```
  
## Example

<p>
Here is a simple example of how to go from a list of boundary nodes to an animation 
of the Delaunay triangulation of its interior.
</p>

```
from delaunay_mesh import mesh

m6 = mesh() # Create a mesh object.

# Define a simple boundary loop.

nodeList = [[0.0, 0.0], [2.0, 0.0], [1.0, 3.0], [0.5, 2.5], [-0.3, 1.9], [-0.3, 0.4]]

# Specify the file that should contain the .mp4 video as well as how large the size of each
frame of the video should be.

fpath = ".\m6.mp4"
m6.vplot_init(fpath, figsize=(6,6))  # Initialize the frame-grabbing functionality.

# Add the boundary edges defined by consecutive nodes from the node list, recording the Delaunay
# mesh that results in each frame.

m6.addBoundaryLoopWithVideo(nodeList)
```

## Requirements

In order for the frame-grabbing to work with matplotlib, it may be necessary to install (and sometimes
uninstall and reinstall) the <code>ffmpeg</code> tool as well as the <code>ffmpeg-python</code> library.

```
conda install ffmpeg
pip install ffmpeg-python
```
